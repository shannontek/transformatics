# Unforced and smoothly forced Navier–Stokes: two explicit targets

> **Current priority and source update — 8 September 2026.** The user has shifted the active work to a full, openly attributed Transformatics textbook: mathematical foundations, human–model collaboration history, academic references, and an explanation of the external result. OpenAI has now released a forced Navier–Stokes breakdown paper and formalization. [Pinned source assessment](NSE_OPENAI_RESULT_BRIDGE_2026_09_08.md). FORCED-D is **IMPORTED** (external authorship; native Lean target build passed; independent Comparator not run), while unforced ROOT and E-prime remain **OPEN**. This project did not complete its own singularity construction. Earlier local FORCED-D OPEN labels and private-proof availability statements below are historical. Preserve the research record; do not restart a new research/DNS campaign as part of the textbook task. No public push, visibility change or deployment is recorded by this update.


**8 September 2026. Both tracks are authorized and OPEN.** The user has
explicitly asked to pursue both. A forced result must retain its own theorem
statement; it does not close the unforced ROOT by relabelling the equation.
The overall objective remains a complete verified Navier–Stokes result.

**Twelfth execution, 8 September (current):** the signed postfocus source
and its [full-flow band comparison](ANALYSIS_NOTES/NSE_ACTUAL_COARSE_BAND_2026_09_08.md)
passed independent AI-agent reviews and root reads. The same original-data
Q_h generates a measurable intermediate frequency band: endpoint velocity
and symmetric-strain lower scales are h^(7/4+o(1)) and h^(1/2+o(1)), above
its initial band tails. Exact q and linear-Z leakage are separately bounded.
The band is coarser than the supplied receiver. Its generated remainder
still has C1 norm at most C h^(1/96) and a vanishing current-window strain
clock; this supplies no automatic next host or infinite trajectory.

The [opposing/cyclic forced calculations](ANALYSIS_NOTES/NSE_COUPLED_STAGES_REVIEW_2026_09_08.md)
retain the complete nonlinear force and all fixed mixed derivatives.
Instantaneous resonance cancellation leaves a nonzero force time jet;
the supplied cyclic-wave product dissipates and its omitted reverse
couplings are real. These restrictions allow changed interior velocities.

The [actual periodic cycle](ANALYSIS_NOTES/NSE_PERIODIC_CYCLE_TRANSFER_2026_09_08.md)
now evolves those nonlinear interactions without forcing. Its full pressure
jets and uniform local remainder prove finite total enstrophy gain for
sufficiently small nu q/A, while kinetic energy decreases. This extends
the existing activation prototype, whose sine datum is a common translation
of the old cosine datum. No new architecture, large velocity gain or shape
return is asserted. The activation lesson teaches the pressure cancellation
and the finite-time gain inequality.

Next: useful later nonlinear feedback and an actual compatible next state,
with pressure, viscosity, localization and one-datum/terminal-force budgets.
Do not repeat the completed postfocus sign or first activation coefficient.
These are restricted written results, not formal PDE certificates or external
expert acceptance. ROOT, E-prime and FORCED-D remain OPEN. No new research
DNS or public release. The earlier checkpoints below are historical.

**Tenth execution:** the [logarithmic host](NSE_LOGARITHMIC_HOST_2026_09_08.md)
now continues the same original unforced datum beyond its receiver focus,
with order-eta ell² rescaled strain and controlled nonlinear error for
small fixed eta. It supplies no next independent seed or infinite sequence.
The fixed-annulus forced exclusion below remains in force.

**Ninth execution:** the [fixed-annulus geometry](ANALYSIS_NOTES/NSE_FIXED_ANNULUS_OBSTRUCTION_2026_09_08.md)
is now excluded for a full compact axisymmetric NS breakdown with smooth
forcing. The [same unforced flow](ANALYSIS_NOTES/NSE_LATER_FLOW_ATTEMPT_2026_09_08.md)
also has a reviewed short further lifetime and a transported almost-affine
core. These change the next tasks below; neither closes either global target.

## 1. The equations and completion conditions

In both tracks the ordinary three-dimensional incompressible equation is

    partial_t u+(u.grad)u+grad p=nu Delta u+f,
    div u=0, nu>0 fixed.

| Track | Input and target | What would establish it |
|---|---|---|
| Unforced ROOT | f=0; smooth periodic divergence-free initial data. | A complete global regularity proof, or a counterexample from one admissible smooth datum. The existing ROOT node is specifically the global regularity claim and remains OPEN. |
| FORCED-D | One smooth periodic divergence-free datum and one prescribed smooth periodic force, with every mixed derivative decaying faster than any power of time. | A proof that no global smooth periodic velocity and pressure solve that datum and force. Finite-time breakdown of the unique preterminal classical solution would suffice. |

The [official Fefferman statement](https://www.claymath.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/navierstokes.pdf),
pp. 1–2, explicitly offers alternatives A–D. A/B use zero force; C/D permit
the specified forces in a breakdown example. Its appended erratum also
requires periodic pressure in the periodic setting. The two-pi period used
in this repository and Clay's unit period differ by a fixed consistent NS
rescaling, which preserves positive viscosity and smoothness.

We start the forced track with periodic alternative D, matching the existing
domain. Alternative C additionally requires rapid spatial decay of every
initial-data and force derivative on R3. A nonlocal pressure or Leray
projection can matter for that stronger spatial requirement; it cannot
be assumed away by copying a periodic argument.

For D it is sufficient to construct a force smooth on the entire closed
time interval through a proposed singular time, with a smooth extension
of compact support in time. Smoothness only on t<T is insufficient.
The force is prescribed data: if constructed from a candidate solution,
its complete extension and derivative bounds must be proved independently
of the candidate's singular limit.

## 2. Why forcing does not make breakdown automatic

For an explicit solenoidal velocity U and pressure P one can define

    f_U=partial_t U+(U.grad)U+grad P-nu Delta U.

That identity makes U a forced solution before any singular time. It
does not establish that f_U is admissible through that time. All its
space and time derivatives, including pressure and cutoff contributions,
belong to the proof.

For example, on the two-pi torus let U=a(t)sin(y)e1 and P=0. Its nonlinear
advection vanishes, and its exact force is

    f_U=[a'(t)+nu a(t)]sin(y)e1.

Setting a(t)=1/(T-t) makes both U and its force singular. Conversely,
if a'+nu a=g is smooth and bounded on a finite interval, then

    a(t)=exp(-nu t)a(0)+integral_0^t exp(-nu(t-s))g(s)ds

stays bounded there. This simple shear cannot furnish smooth-force
breakdown. A successful forced construction must use additional dynamics.

## 3. Work shared by the tracks

The [localized profile extension](NSE_LOCALIZED_PROFILE_2026_09_08.md)
now supplies a finite actual NS region with nearly uniform gradient,
complete pressure, heat evolution and all Fourier correction modes.
Its error is controlled through a finite endpoint. The subsequent
[later-flow lemma](ANALYSIS_NOTES/NSE_LATER_FLOW_ATTEMPT_2026_09_08.md)
extends that same solution by c ell^(-27/8), and preserves a transported
radius-c k core with rescaled gradient error O(ell^(-1/4)) for an additional
ell^(-5) interval. This is short persistence of existing strain, not a new
descendant or an infinite construction.

The [next-seed analysis](NSE_NEXT_SEED_ANALYSIS_2026_09_08.md) proves that
the current full solution cannot develop dominant strain at the proposed
next scale h^(9/4) within its proved interval. The
[generated-source calculation](ANALYSIS_NOTES/NSE_GENERATED_RECEIVER_2026_09_08.md)
shows that the leading cross source was already counted in the existing
handover. Fixed flat profiles also retain the full-support C3 seed cost.
Forcing may supply a different reset or seed; its cost then appears in
f and must pass the all-orders smoothness requirements.

## 4. What the forced review establishes

The three calculations have passed separate agent reviews at their stated
written scope. The [review record](ANALYSIS_NOTES/NSE_FORCED_STAGE_REVIEW_2026_09_08.md)
includes the corrections and distinguishes them from a complete proof.

| Calculation | Established result | Remaining obligation |
|---|---|---|
| [Physical force and terminal extension](NSE_FORCED_ADMISSIBILITY_2026_09_08.md) | The existing residual gives a small physical L1-time/L2-space force, h^(39/8-o(1)). A single sequence with summable bounds for every fixed mixed derivative has a smooth terminal extension. | The current estimates do not bound all physical force derivatives along an infinite construction. A diverging upper bound is inconclusive. |
| [Ordinary viscosity](NSE_FORCED_VISCOSITY_2026_09_08.md) | Reusing the released compact Euler velocity fails smooth NS forcing, even after a pressure change. In the fixed-background principal two-component wave equation, both channels instead undergo the same heat smoothing. | Prove the full viscous stage, including the changed older flow, lower-order drift, localization and force recovery. |
| [Finite reset](ANALYSIS_NOTES/NSE_FORCED_RESET_2026_09_08.md) | Smooth forcing can steer a finite solenoidal state exactly. Holding a shrinking fixed-shape compact core stationary has a genuine force lower bound proportional to nu times amplitude divided by radius squared. | A useful return must arise from evolving dynamics with its complete force controlled. Independent finite steering does not provide an infinite trajectory. |

For the promising principal identity, let n be a nonzero phase Fourier
index and D the integrated viscous clock. The two-component amplitude obeys

    R_NS,n(t)=exp(-n^2 D(t)) R_Euler,n(t).

Thus a selected central zero in the outgoing reduced-vorticity component
remains zero at principal order. For a general profile F, the retained
profile is exp(D partial_s^2)F, not a common scalar multiple of F. This
identity supplies a reason to attempt the viscous construction; it does
not prove that its complete return survives.

Ordinary NS breakdown with admissible smooth forcing must also have
unbounded velocity: a bounded velocity and finite force norms give an H1
continuation estimate. The released Euler construction's bounded-velocity
conclusion therefore cannot be retained in a successful NS adaptation.

## 5. Next work and its acceptance test

**Forced track:** choose a full flow that escapes the now-excluded compact
fixed-annulus axisymmetric geometry, then derive one complete viscous
insertion/return on a specified older state. The
[exact normalized equations and spatial commutator](ANALYSIS_NOTES/NSE_VISCOUS_STAGE_ATTEMPT_2026_09_08.md)
show that both scalar channels can use the same full diffusion operator,
but this alone does not preserve a spatial return. Axis approach requires
smooth Cartesian parity and its actual Reynolds/force budget; broken
symmetry requires the complete additional three-dimensional interactions.
Keep fixed physical viscosity, periodic pressure and every localization
term. A finite-order mixed-force estimate and nonempty velocity-gain margin
must precede any infinite common schedule. The
[gain audit](ANALYSIS_NOTES/NSE_FORCE_GAIN_AUDIT_2026_09_08.md) prevents
double-counting inverse-frequency recovery or treating arbitrarily high
frequency on one fixed host as a free improvement.

**Unforced track:** use the proved logarithmic continuation to identify
a signed new independent receiving contribution on the full time-dependent
Q_h state. The full-solution frequency exclusion continues through this
longer interval; its small-coefficient strain clock is not an activation
theorem. The exact source still lacks a signed new-seed lower bound.
Any inherited seed requires the same original smooth datum and its full
derivative cost. Do not repeat the completed finite continuation estimate.

The [execution brief](../prompts/nse_next_attempt_2026_09_08.md) gives the
starting estimates, required outputs and failure tests for both tasks.
Neither track advances to an infinite construction by choosing a different
finite example for each derivative order.

No private internal-model proof is available as an input. Public mathematical
sources and their versioned statements remain the evidence. No publication
or complete proof claim follows from establishing this second target.
